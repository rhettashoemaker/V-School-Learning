            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Flowers, like food, decorations, music, and special dress help us mark the special occasions in our lives. And thanks to the global nature of the floral industry, we can have our favorite flowers year round.
            <br/>However, that globalness comes with a couple downsides; environmental impact and expensive prices, which you can read more about under the <a href="index.educational.html" class="inline-link">Educational</a> tab. 
            <br/>To sidestep those issues and to support and celebrate our community, we design our arrangments from just what grows in the collective "floral shop" that is the yards of participating Springville gardeners. While that means we don't always have the year-long variety that traditional florists do, we do have more budget-friendly arrangments that can enable flowers to be part of daily life. 
            <br/>Check out some arrangements we've made just from what grows in the backyard in the <a href="index.arrangements.html" class="inline-link">Arrangements</a> tab. Click on the <a href="index.ordering.html" class="inline-link">Ordering</a> tab to place your order. If you're interested in selling us some of the materials from your yard, look under the <a href="index.contact.html" class="inline-link">Contact</a> tab. We're excited to hear from you!
